Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: There are couple of reasons for keeping a remote repository. First, if you are collaborating on a project, different people may have their own local repositories. In this case, it would make sense to periodically sync to a common remote repository. Second, your local machine might not be very reliable (e.g., infrequent back-ups) in which case you may want to keep a remote repository on a more reliable machine.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: You may not want your commit to be visible in your remote repository in
some cases. One example would be when you are trying something out on an
experimental basis.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?
A: clone is used for copying a repository from one location to another. Fork
is similar to clone except that it is used for cloning a repository from one
user account to another on GitHub. Finally, branch is used within a repository
to create another path of commits for reasons like experimentation.
